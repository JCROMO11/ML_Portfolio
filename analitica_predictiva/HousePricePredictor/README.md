# House Price Prediction Project with Flask and Machine Learning

This project deploys a machine learning model to predict house prices using Flask as a web server and a pre-trained model in Python. The prediction is made based on certain parameters of the house, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and others.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- scikit-learn (or any other library used to train the model)
- pandas
- pickle (for loading the saved model)
