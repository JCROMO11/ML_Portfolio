This project demonstrates a simple sentiment analysis pipeline using Logistic Regression. It classifies sentences into `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral` sentiments based on their textual content.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To classify sentences into sentiment categories using logistic regression and bag-of-words features.
- **Dataset**: `sentences.csv.zip`, containing text phrases and their sentiment labels (`positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`).
- **Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Key Outputs**:
  - Trained model (`clf.pickle`)
  - Fitted vectorizer (`vectorizer.pkl`)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`
