# Fuel Efficiency Prediction

This project explores various machine learning models to predict the fuel efficiency (measured in MPG) of cars based on their features, using the `auto_mpg.csv` dataset.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Build models to predict MPG using features like horsepower, weight, and displacement.
- **Dataset**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Auto MPG Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg).
- **Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Neural Network (MLPRegressor)
  - Simple model using horsepower as a single feature
- **Evaluation Metric**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
